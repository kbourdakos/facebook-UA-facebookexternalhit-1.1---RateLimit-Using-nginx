# This part goes inside of nginx' http{} or you can include it using custom .conf file 
# We'll adjust the rate limit to a conservative figure, say 5 requests per minute, and keep the burst allowance at 5 to accommodate short-term spikes in traffic.

# map UA to key
map $http_user_agent $limit_key {
"~*facebookexternalhit" fbhit;
default                 "";
}

# setting rate against the UA, telling ngxin to responde 429
limit_req_zone $limit_key zone=fbhit:10m rate=5r/m;
# return 429
limit_req_status 429;


# That part goes to vhost configuration. The sample is about location / {}
limit_req zone=fbhit burst=5 nodelay;

Expected Behavior
-----------------
  
Request Handling: 
Nginx will allow up to 5 requests per minute from the Facebook crawler. This means that within any given minute, if the crawler sends more than 5 requests, subsequent requests will be delayed until the next minute starts.

Burst Handling: 
With a burst allowance of 5, Nginx can temporarily accept up to 10 requests in a single minute (the base rate of 5 plus the burst allowance of 5).

Response to Excess Traffic: 
If the Facebook crawler exceeds the combined rate and burst limits (in this case, 10 requests in a single minute), Nginx will start to respond with HTTP status codes indicating that the request rate is too high.

Effectiveness Against Overaggressive Crawling: 
This configuration aims to reduce the impact of overly aggressive crawling by the Facebook crawler without completely blocking it.
